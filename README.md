## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental to computer science and play a key role in improving the performance of applications. This repository includes implementations of different data structures such as queues, stacks, linked lists, trees, and more. Each implementation is optimized for efficiency and readability, and is designed to work with generic types using the C language.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Queue**: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.
- **Stack**: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.
- **Linked List**: A list of elements where each element points to the next.
- **Doubly Linked Circular List**: A circular list of elements where each node points to its predecessor and successor.
- **Binary Tree**: A tree structure where each node has at most two children.
- **AVL Tree**: A balanced tree structure with AVL implementation.
- **Red Black Tree**: A balanced tree structure with red-black implementation.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that associates keys with values for fast lookup.

More structures will be added in the future, such as priority queues, graphs, and more.

## Features

- Generic data types support.
- Efficient memory management.
- Easy-to-use API.
- Well-documented code with inline comments.

## Installation

To use any of the data structures in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine or download the header and implementation.
Make sure you include the header correctly in your project and statically link it through the compiler..
